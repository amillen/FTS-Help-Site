# Cabinets

**Cabinets** are a major part of FTS because they control where inventory is stored, tracked, and managed. The **Cabinet** module is where items are assigned to a location. 

**Also known as:** *Virtual Cabinets*, *Toolbox Cabinets*, *Cabinet Locations*

## What is a Cabinet?

A cabinet can be either **physical** or **virtual**:  

- **Physical Cabinet**: A real storage unit such as a Lista toolbox or vending machine.  
- **Virtual Cabinet**: A location that functions like a cabinet in the system but does not physically exist as a traditional toolbox.  
  - Examples: a coolant shed, warehouse racking, or an open storage area.  
  - Even though there isn’t a physical cabinet, FTS can still track inventory at that location using cabinet features.  
  - **Important:** All Virtual Cabinets should use the cabinet type **Traditional – No Lock**.

## What You Can Do in the Cabinet Module

- **Create or Edit Cabinets**: Add new cabinets or update existing ones.  
- **Search and Review Inventory**: Look inside a specific cabinet to see the items stored there.  
- **Change Bin Locations**: Reassign items to different locations inside a cabinet.  
- **Adjust Min/Max**: Update stocking levels for items.  
- **Enter On-Hand Quantities**: Record the current quantity of items in a cabinet.

## Why Cabinets Matter

- Cabinets are the foundation of **location-based inventory tracking** in FTS.  
- They provide visibility into **where items are stored** and ensure stock levels are managed correctly.  
- Virtual cabinets extend the same features to non-traditional storage areas, giving you flexibility in how you track inventory.
