# Cabinet Types

Cabinets in FTS can be one of several types. The cabinet type determines whether the cabinet is physical or virtual, and whether it is controlled by a locking mechanism.

**Also known as:** *Cabinet Categories*, *Cabinet Type Options*

## Traditional – No Lock
A cabinet or location that is **unmanaged** and not controlled by any locking mechanism.  
- Use this for **Virtual Cabinets** (e.g., coolant shed, warehouse racking, open storage).  
- No Device ID is required.

## Westlock
A cabinet controlled by the **FTS Cloud locking mechanism (Nimbis)**.  
- Requires a **Device ID** from the control box.

---

## Bulk
A bulk cabinet controlled by the **FTS Cloud bulk locking mechanism (Nimbis)**.  
- Requires a **Device ID** from the control box.  
- Designed for larger-volume storage where bulk access is controlled.
