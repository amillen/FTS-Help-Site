# Creating Multiple Locations with Cabinet Builder (Cabinet Builder Tool)

> See [Locations Overview](xref:cabinets.locations) for more about what locations are and the different ways to create them.

**Also known as:** *Cabinet Builder*, *Bulk Location Creator*, *Build Multiple Locations*

The **Cabinet Builder** tool is used to create many locations (bins) in a cabinet all at once. This is especially helpful when you are setting up a new cabinet or adding rows and columns to an existing one.

> **Tip:** Even if you don’t plan to use every bin right away, it’s best practice to build out as many physical locations as possible. This makes it easier to assign items later.

## When to Use Cabinet Builder

- **New Cabinet Setup**: Fill out all drawers, rows, and columns during the initial cabinet build.  
- **Expanding an Existing Cabinet**: Add new drawers or bins to cabinets that already have some locations created.  
- **Not for Single Locations**: If you only need one location, use [Creating a New Location](xref:cabinets.create-location).

## Steps to Use Cabinet Builder

1. Navigate to the **Cabinets** module from the [Dashboard](xref:dashboard).
2. Find the cabinet you want to build out and click the **gear icon** on the right side.
3. Choose **Cabinet Builder** from the menu.
4. Set up the cabinet drawers, columns, and rows (see details below).
5. Confirm and create the locations.
6. Use the links provided to either:
   - Create more locations, or  
   - Go directly to the locations you just built.

## Drawer Setup

Select the drawers you want to build.  
- On a computer: click the starting drawer (e.g., `01`), hold **Ctrl**, and click the ending drawer (e.g., `11`).  
- All drawers between those numbers will be selected.

---

## Columns Setup

Choose how many **columns** the drawer should have.  
- Columns are labeled alphabetically: A, B, C, D, etc.  
- Example: Selecting **A–F** creates 6 columns.

---

## Rows Setup

Choose the **rows** for each column.  
- **From Row**: The starting row (e.g., `01`).  
- **To Row**: The ending row (e.g., `05`).  
- You don’t have to start at 1 — you can continue from the last row used (e.g., start at `06`).  

---

## Locations Created

When the builder runs, you’ll see a confirmation of how many new locations were created.  
- Click the first **link** to create more locations.  
- Click the second **link** to go directly to the newly created locations.
