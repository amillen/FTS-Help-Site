# Suppliers

## Overview
The Suppliers module allows you to add and manage your suppliers within the FTS system. You can create new suppliers, edit existing supplier information, and view a list of all suppliers.

## How Suppliers Are Used
Suppliers are used when creating [purchase orders](../PurchaseOrders/index.md) to specify where [items](../Items/index.md) are being ordered from. Every [item](../Items/index.md) must have a supplier assigned to it and will use that supplier when creating an [automatic purchase order](automatic-purchase-orders.md).
