# Creating a Custom Report

**Also known as:** *Custom Analytics*, *Filtered Reports*

Custom reports let you tailor data views with filters and saved conditions. This is helpful if you often run the same filtered report.

## Steps to Create a Custom Report

1. Navigate to the **Reports** module from the [Dashboard](xref:dashboard).  
2. Choose **Custom Report**.  
3. Select your base report type (e.g., Transaction, Inventory Value).  
4. Apply filters:  
   - Field filters (e.g., by Job, Station, Supplier).  
   - Conditions (equals, does not equal, begins with, contains).  
5. Save the report for reuse.
