# Additional Employee Tabs

Each employee record in FTS has additional tabs that provide extra information or custom setup options.

---

## History
Shows the [Transactions](xref:transactions) for this employee.  
- Similar to the **History tab** on Stations or Locations.  
- Displays all issues, returns, adjustments, and other activity tied to the employee.  
- Use filters to narrow by date, transaction type, or item.

---

## Access Control
Lists any [Access Controls](xref:access-controls) applied to this employee.  
- Controls which cabinets, stations, or items the employee can see or use.  
- Useful for limiting visibility or restricting access by role.  

---

## Reporting Field Default Values
Allows you to pre-fill [Reporting Fields](xref:reporting-fields) for this employee.  
- When the employee issues an item, the selected fields will already be filled in.  
- Saves time for employees who usually use the same reporting field values.  
- Commonly used for:
  - Departments (e.g., “Maintenance” pre-filled as the department).  
  - Jobs or cost centers where the employee rarely switches.  

### How to Set Defaults
1. Open the employee record.  
2. Go to the **Reporting Field Default Values** tab.  
3. Select or type the default values for the available reporting fields.  
4. Save changes.  

> **Tip:** Defaults can be changed anytime if the employee’s role or reporting needs change.

## FAQ

### What is Employee History used for?
It shows all transactions for that employee (issues, returns, adjustments). It’s helpful for audits and tracking activity.

### Can I restrict which stations or cabinets an employee can use?
Yes. Use the **Access Control** tab to apply limits.

### What happens if I set Reporting Field Default Values?
Those values will automatically appear when the employee issues an item. The employee can change them if needed (unless the field is restricted).

### Do defaults affect reporting?
Yes. The defaults are written to the item’s reporting field at checkout, ensuring consistent data entry.
