# Stations

Stations group a collection of cabinets to represent either the **physical layout** of your facility or to allow **separate purchasing and visibility**. A station is essentially a way to organize cabinets under a common grouping.

**Also known as:** *Station Groups*, *Customer Stations*, *Station Locations*

## Why Use Stations?

- **Organize Cabinets**: Cabinets can be grouped by building, floor, or department.  
- **Separate Purchasing**: Each station can have its own purchase orders.  
- **Customer Visibility**: Stations let customers see only the cabinets assigned to their station.  
- **Spoke-Hub Model**: Similar to a distribution model where a central hub manages multiple spokes (stations).
