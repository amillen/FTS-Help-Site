# Creating an Unapproved Purchase Order (Unapproved PO)

**Also known as:** *Add Unapproved PO*, *Pending Approval PO*, *Approval Required PO*

An **Unapproved Purchase Order** is created automatically by the system but requires manual approval before being sent to the supplier. If not approved within the expiration window, it is canceled.
