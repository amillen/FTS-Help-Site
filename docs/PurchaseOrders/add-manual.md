# Creating a Manual Purchase Order (Adding a PO)

**Also known as:** *Add Manual PO*, *Create PO*, *New PO*

A **Manual Purchase Order** is created directly in the Purchase Orders module. Use this when you want to order items outside of automatic or scheduled runs.

## FAQ

### Whatâ€™s the difference between a Manual and Automatic PO?
- **Manual PO**: Created directly by a user.  
- **Automatic PO**: Created by the system based on min/max levels or schedules.  

### Can I create a PO for one station only?
Yes. When creating the PO, choose the station instead of All Stations.  

### Can I add notes to the supplier?
Yes. Use the **Notes** field in the header section. Notes will appear on the printed/emailed PO.  

### What happens after I save the PO?
The PO becomes active in the system. You can then send it, export it, or track its progress.
