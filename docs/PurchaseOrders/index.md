# Purchase Orders (POs)

The **Purchase Orders (POs)** module is where all orders to suppliers are managed in FTS. You can create new purchase orders, review open or past orders, approve pending orders, export, or reverse receipts.  

**Also known as:** *POs*, *Supplier Orders*

## Types of Purchase Orders

FTS supports three types of purchase orders:  

- **Manual PO**: Create anytime, for any item, directly from the Purchase Orders module.  
- **Automatic PO**: Runs automatically on a schedule based on min/max requirements. Sent directly to the supplier without review.  
- **Unapproved PO**: Runs automatically, but requires manual approval before sending. If not approved in time, it expires.  

> **Note:** Do not confuse **Unapproved POs** with **draft POs**.  
> - A **draft PO** is created when you uncheck the **Approved** box while creating a PO. Draft POs are incomplete orders, not tied to the approval workflow.  
> - The **PO Approval Process workflow** applies only to Approved POs and must be completed before the PO is sent to the supplier.

## Approval Process

Purchase Orders can optionally use an **Approval Process**:  
- Create a chain of approvers.  
- Apply spending limits per person.  
- Require final approval before sending to supplier.  

See [Purchase Order Approval Process](xref:purchase-orders.approval-process).
