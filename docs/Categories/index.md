# Categories

Categories are used to group items together for easier searching and purchasing. Think of them like **e-commerce website categories** â€” you can organize items into logical groups to make them easier to find.  

**Also known as:** *Item Categories*, *Groups*, *Custom Categories*

## What Categories Are (and Are Not)

- An **Item can be assigned to zero, one, or many categories**.  
- Categories are **only used** for:  
  - Assisting with searching for items.  
  - Grouping items together for purchasing.  
- **Most common use:** Grouping like items, or grouping all items needed for a specific process, part, or run.  
- **Not used for reporting**: Categories do not appear in reports and cannot be used to report on historical transactions or spend.  
  - If you need to capture data for reporting (e.g., job number, part number, cost code), use [Reporting Fields](xref:reporting-fields) instead.
