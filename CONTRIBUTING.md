# Contributing

Thanks for helping improve the docs!

## How to propose changes
1. Fork the repo
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/topic`)
3. Make edits (Markdown, YAML, code samples)
4. Build locally: `docfx docfx.json` and verify `_site`
5. Open a Pull Request to `main`

## Style
- Prefer clear, concise language.
- Use fenced code blocks with language tag.
- Cross-link using DocFX `xref` where helpful.

## PR checks
- CI must pass (DocFX build).
