Click on Add New Rule. Choose a Rule Type (see below). Configure the rule details. Select which employees the rule applies to (or does not apply to). Save the rule. Rule Types Item Rule Restricts use of a specific item. Can limit how many times it can be issued. Can set a time window (e.g., 1 per day, 3 per week). Example: Safety glasses limited to 1 pair per employee per week. Drawer Rule Restricts access to a cabinet drawer. Example: Only supervisors can access Drawer 4 in Cabinet A. Cabinet Rule Restricts access to an entire cabinet. Example: Block employees in the Milling department from accessing the Lathe cabinet. Station Rule Restricts access to all cabinets within a station. Example: Limit certain employees to the “Maintenance” station only. Issue Other Item Rule Requires employees to issue one item before another. Example: Employees must issue “Old Inserts” before they can issue “New Inserts.” Employee Scope When creating a rule, you can specify: Applies To: Employees who the rule affects. Does Not Apply To: Employees who are exempt. Tip: Use this to apply rules to departments, roles, or individuals. Audit Logs All rule changes are recorded in the Audit Logs tab. Shows who created, edited, or deleted a rule. Provides accountability and traceability. FAQ Can I restrict an item to supervisors only? Yes. Create an Item Rule and set the Does Not Apply To list to include only supervisors. How do I limit frequency of issuing an item? Use an Item Rule with Time Options (e.g., max 1 issue per week). Can I block an entire cabinet? Yes. Use a Cabinet Rule to restrict access to the whole cabinet. What’s the difference between Drawer and Cabinet rules? Drawer Rule = restricts a single drawer. Cabinet Rule = restricts every drawer in the cabinet. Can I use Issue Other Item for safety stock rotation? Yes. For example, require employees to issue “Old Stock” before they can issue “New Stock.” Related Topics Access Control Overview Employees Items Stations Cabinets"

    "summary": "Access Control The Access Control module allows administrators to restrict employee access to items, drawers, cabinets, or stations. Rules are created that define who can (or cannot) issue items and under what conditions. Also known as: Restrictions, Permissions, Access Rules What Access Control Is Access Control creates rules that limit inventory access. Rules can apply to: Item – restrict how much or how often an item can be issued. Drawer – limit access to specific cabinet drawers. Cabinet – limit access to an entire cabinet. Station – limit access to everything within a station. Issue Other Item – require employees to issue a substitute item before issuing the original. Important: Access Control is a software restriction only. It cannot physically stop an employee from opening a drawer if the cabinet locks are shared. Always treat it as an inventory management tool, not a security system. Examples Limit safety glasses to 1 pair per employee per week. Restrict a supervisor-only drawer to supervisors. Block the Milling department from seeing or issuing items at the Lathe station. Require employees to issue “old stock” (e.g., older inserts) before they can issue “new stock.” Adding a New Rule Navigate to the Access Control module from the Dashboard. Click Add New Rule. Choose a Rule Type: Item, Drawer, Cabinet, Station, or Issue Other Item. Select the item, drawer, cabinet, or station to apply the rule. Configure options (time intervals, quantity limits, or substitute items). Choose which employees the rule applies to (or doesn’t apply to). Save the rule. Audit Logs Tab The Audit Logs tab shows all changes made to access control rules. Includes who made the change and when. Provides accountability for all rule creation, edits, and deletions. FAQ Can I restrict access by employee? Yes. When creating a rule, choose which employees the rule Applies To or Doesn’t Apply To. Can I limit how often an item can be issued? Yes. Create an Item rule, enable Time Options, and set a quantity limit with a time interval (e.g., 1 pair of safety glasses per week). Can I require substitutes to be used before an item? Yes. Use the Issue Other Item rule to make employees issue a secondary item before the primary one. Does Access Control prevent drawer opening? No. Drawer restrictions are software-only. All drawers open on the same lock backbone — so use these rules for inventory control, not physical security. Related Topics Employees Items Stations Cabinets"

    "summary": "Additional Location Tabs Each location in a cabinet has several tabs that provide extra details and controls. These tabs are visible when viewing a location. Open POs Displays information about the open purchase orders for this location. Shows details of any active POs. Provides a link to navigate directly to the PO. Alerts The Alerts tab is used to set up critical quantity notifications for a location. When the quantity falls to or below a set point, alerts are sent to the station and/or supplier. How to Open the Alerts Tab Navigate to the Cabinets module from the Dashboard. Select the cabinet that contains the location you want to set alerts for. Click on the location. Open the Alerts tab. How to Set an Alert Type in the Alert Quantity (the level at which you want to be notified). Optionally, add a Note to remind you why you set the alert. Click the plus (+) button to save the alert. Choose one or more notification options: Email Supplier: Send an alert to the Supplier’s email(s). Email Supervisor: Send an alert to the Station’s Notification email(s). Alert Once: Only send the email once when the quantity reaches the alert level. If unchecked, emails will be sent every time the quantity is reduced to or below the alert level. FAQ: Alerts What is an Alert Quantity? A threshold you set for an item’s on-hand quantity. When the item reaches or falls below this number, an alert is triggered. Who gets alerted? Suppliers: if “Email Supplier” is checked. Station Supervisors: if “Email Supervisor” is checked. What does “Alert Once” mean? Checked: Sends a single alert the first time the quantity hits or drops below the alert level. Unchecked: Sends an alert every time the quantity decreases while at or below the alert level. Can I add notes to alerts? Yes. Notes are optional and can help remind you why an alert was created (e.g., “Critical for maintenance” or “Backup supplier delay”). Can I set multiple alerts for the same location? Yes. You can create more than one alert with different quantities or notification options. History Shows the Transactions for this location. Similar to Station History, but limited only to this location. Use grid filters to search by date, item, or transaction type. Audit Logs Shows all changes that have been made to this location since it was created. Includes who made the change and when it was made. Useful for compliance and tracking adjustments.

    "summary": "Creating Multiple Locations with Cabinet Builder (Cabinet Builder Tool) See Locations Overview for more about what locations are and the different ways to create them. Also known as: Cabinet Builder, Bulk Location Creator, Build Multiple Locations The Cabinet Builder tool is used to create many locations (bins) in a cabinet all at once. This is especially helpful when you are setting up a new cabinet or adding rows and columns to an existing one. Tip: Even if you don’t plan to use every bin right away, it’s best practice to build out as many physical locations as possible. This makes it easier to assign items later. When to Use Cabinet Builder New Cabinet Setup: Fill out all drawers, rows, and columns during the initial cabinet build. Expanding an Existing Cabinet: Add new drawers or bins to cabinets that already have some locations created. Not for Single Locations: If you only need one location, use Creating a New Location. Steps to Use Cabinet Builder Navigate to the Cabinets module from the Dashboard. Find the cabinet you want to build out and click the gear icon on the right side. Choose Cabinet Builder from the menu. Set up the cabinet drawers, columns, and rows (see details below). Confirm and create the locations. Use the links provided to either: Create more locations, or Go directly to the locations you just built. Drawer Setup Select the drawers you want to build. On a computer: click the starting drawer (e.g., 01), hold Ctrl, and click the ending drawer (e.g., 11). All drawers between those numbers will be selected. Columns Setup Choose how many columns the drawer should have. Columns are labeled alphabetically: A, B, C, D, etc. Example: Selecting A–F creates 6 columns. Rows Setup Choose the rows for each column. From Row: The starting row (e.g., 01). To Row: The ending row (e.g., 05). You don’t have to start at 1 — you can continue from the last row used (e.g., start at 06). Locations Created When the builder runs, you’ll see a confirmation of how many new locations were created. Click the first link to create more locations. Click the second link to go directly to the newly created locations. FAQ What is Cabinet Builder? A tool that lets you create multiple locations (bins) in a cabinet at once, instead of creating them one by one. When should I use Cabinet Builder vs. Create Location? Use Cabinet Builder for bulk setup (entire drawers, rows, or columns). Use Create Location for one-off, manual locations. Can I add more locations to a cabinet later? Yes. You can use Cabinet Builder again to add new drawers or expand existing ones.

    "summary": "Mass Importing and Updating Locations (Location Import Tool) See Locations Overview for more about what locations are and the different ways to create them. Also known as: Location Import, Bulk Location Upload, Mass Update Locations The Location Import Tool lets you add or update many cabinet locations at once using an Excel template. This saves time when setting up a new cabinet, assigning items to locations, or updating details like Min/Max, Capacity, or Restock status. Tip: Use Location Import when you have many locations to load. If you only need one location, use Creating a New Location. For building drawers, rows, and columns, use Cabinet Builder. Before You Begin Item IDs must already exist in the system before you can import them into a location. Each location must be unique — two items cannot share the same drawer/row/column unless Location Expansion is enabled. Use the Western Tool & Supply Item ID whenever possible. This makes purchasing smoother and avoids having to redo imports later. Steps to Import Locations Navigate to the Cabinets module from the Dashboard. Select the cabinet you want to update. Click the cloud upload button in the top right corner. Download the Location Import Template (Excel). You can download a blank template or a sample template (delete sample rows before using). Fill out the template with your location details and item assignments: Drawer, Column, Row Item ID (must already exist in Items) Min, Max, Capacity, Restock, Expansion (as needed) Save the file to your computer with a clear name (e.g., Cabinet1_LocationImport.xlsx). Return to the Import Page and click Choose File to upload your template. Review the preview for errors (see below). Click Import to create the new locations. Updating Existing Locations If locations already exist and you want to change them: On the Import Page, toggle from Create (default) to Update. Upload your updated template file. Review the preview to confirm changes. Click Update to apply changes. Verify that your updates appear in the cabinet. Tip: For large changes, first run an Export from the Import Page. This gives you a pre-filled template with your current cabinet data. Update only what you need, then re-import. Common Errors and Fixes Item ID Not Found Cause: The item doesn’t exist in the system or the ID is incorrect. Fix: Add the item to Items or correct the ID in your template. Number Formatting Cause: Excel may drop leading zeros (e.g., 01 becomes 1). Fix: Change the cell format to Text before saving. Duplicate Locations Cause: Two rows in the template define the same drawer/row/column. Fix: Remove duplicates and re-import. Import vs Update Cause: Importing a location that already exists. Fix: Switch toggle to Update when modifying existing locations. FAQ When should I use Location Import vs Cabinet Builder? Location Import: Best for assigning items, updating Min/Max, or editing many locations. Cabinet Builder: Best for creating a grid of drawers, rows, and columns during initial setup. Can I assign items to locations during import? Yes. Add the Item ID to the row for the location. The item must already exist in Items. What happens if my file has errors? The import preview will highlight issues. Fix the file (e.g., wrong Item ID, duplicates, bad formatting) and upload again. Nothing is saved until you click Import or Update. Can I undo an import? No direct undo. To fix mistakes, correct the template and re-import with the Update option. Related Topics Cabinets (Overview) Creating a New Cabinet Creating a New Location Cabinet Builder Items"

Also known as: Create Location, Add Location, Set Up Location, Bin To create a new location inside a cabinet, follow these steps: Navigate to the Cabinets module from the Dashboard. Click on the cabinet where you want to create a location. Click on Create New Location. Fill in the location details (see below). Click Save to add the location. Tip: Locations are defined in a grid pattern inside drawers — with rows and columns, similar to Excel. Location Fields (same as before — Drawer, Column, Row, Item, Min, Max, Capacity, Location Expansion, Restock) Moving an Item to a New Location When an item is assigned to a location, a Move link will appear. This lets you move the item to a different location. What Moving Includes When you move an item to a new location (or swap it with another item), all data tied to the original location moves with it. This includes: Open purchase orders Transaction history Quantity on hand Unreturned inventory Alerts Min/Max values Capacity setting In short: moving an item is a full relocation of the item and its associated data. How to Move an Item Click the Move link next to the item. A modal window will open. Choose the destination: Station Cabinet Drawer Column Row Select the new location: You may choose an empty location, or You may choose a location that already has an item. If the Destination Location is Empty The item (and all associated data) will be moved directly to that location. If the Destination Location Already Has an Item A confirmation dialog will appear asking if you want to swap locations. Click Yes: The two items (and all their associated data) will switch places. Click No: The move process is canceled. FAQ What is a location? A location is a bin inside a cabinet. Each location is defined by a drawer, column, and row. Do I have to assign an item when creating a location? No. Items can be assigned later if needed. How do Min and Max affect purchasing? Min: When stock falls to or below this amount, the item appears on the next PO. Max: The PO will order enough to bring the quantity back up to this amount. What’s the difference between Capacity and Max? Capacity: Theoretical number of items that could fit in the location. Max: How much the system will order up to. Capacity does not restrict receiving or purchasing. How do I move an item to a new location? Click the Move link, choose the destination, and confirm. If the new location has an item, you can choose to swap them or cancel. What happens when I move an item? All of the item’s data moves with it — including open POs, transactions, on-hand quantity, unreturned inventory, alerts, min/max, and capacity settings.

    "title": "Locations/Bins | Future Tool Systems",
    "summary": "Locations A Location (sometimes called a bin) is the smallest unit of storage inside a cabinet. Every item in FTS must be assigned to a location so its quantity, min/max levels, and activity can be tracked. Locations are defined in a grid pattern inside each cabinet — made up of drawers, columns, and rows (similar to Excel). Also known as: Bins, Cabinet Locations, Storage Locations Why Locations Matter Inventory Tracking: Each location holds the current quantity of its assigned item. Purchasing Control: Min/Max values on a location determine when items are re-ordered. Flexibility: Locations can be created manually, in bulk with Cabinet Builder, or with a spreadsheet import. Accuracy: Keeping item assignments and counts tied to locations ensures clean reporting and auditing. Mobility: Items can be moved between locations when needed, and all of their data (open POs, transactions, on-hand quantities, alerts, etc.) moves with them. Methods to Create Locations There are three ways to create locations inside a cabinet. Each method is best for a different situation. Method Best For How It Works Example Use Case Create a New Location One-off, single locations Manually add a single location by selecting drawer, column, row, and optional item details. You need to add a new location in drawer 3, row 5, column B. Cabinet Builder Building many empty locations quickly Select drawers, rows, and columns to auto-generate multiple locations at once. You’re setting up a new cabinet with 10 drawers, each with 6 columns and 5 rows. Location Import Assigning items or updating many locations Fill out an Excel template with locations, items, Min/Max, Capacity, etc., then upload it. You want to update 200 locations to assign items and adjust Min/Max values. Quick Recommendations Use Create a New Location for one location at a time. Use Cabinet Builder for bulk creation of empty grids. Use Location Import for bulk updates or assigning items to many locations. FAQ What is a location? A location (or bin) is a storage spot inside a cabinet, defined by drawer, column, and row. Do items have to be assigned to a location? Yes. Every item must be tied to a location so the system can track quantities and purchasing rules. Can I move items between locations? Yes. Items can be moved to a new location using the Move link. When an item is moved (or swapped), all of its associated data — including open purchase orders, transactions, on-hand quantities, unreturned inventory, alerts, and min/max settings — moves with it. Which method should I use to create locations? Few locations → Create a New Location Lots of locations (rows/columns) → Cabinet Builder Lots of items or updates → Location Import Can a location hold more than one item? Yes, if Location Expansion is enabled. Related Topics Cabinets (Overview) Creating a New Cabinet Creating a New Location Cabinet Builder Location Import Items"

    "summary": "Cabinets Cabinets are a major part of FTS because they control where inventory is stored, tracked, and managed. The Cabinet module is where items are assigned to a location. Also known as: Virtual Cabinets, Toolbox Cabinets, Cabinet Locations What is a Cabinet? A cabinet can be either physical or virtual: Physical Cabinet: A real storage unit such as a Lista toolbox or vending machine. Virtual Cabinet: A location that functions like a cabinet in the system but does not physically exist as a traditional toolbox. Examples: a coolant shed, warehouse racking, or an open storage area. Even though there isn’t a physical cabinet, FTS can still track inventory at that location using cabinet features. Important: All Virtual Cabinets should use the cabinet type Traditional – No Lock. What You Can Do in the Cabinet Module Create or Edit Cabinets: Add new cabinets or update existing ones. Search and Review Inventory: Look inside a specific cabinet to see the items stored there. Change Bin Locations: Reassign items to different locations inside a cabinet. Adjust Min/Max: Update stocking levels for items. Enter On-Hand Quantities: Record the current quantity of items in a cabinet. Why Cabinets Matter Cabinets are the foundation of location-based inventory tracking in FTS. They provide visibility into where items are stored and ensure stock levels are managed correctly. Virtual cabinets extend the same features to non-traditional storage areas, giving you flexibility in how you track inventory. Examples Physical Cabinets: Lista toolbox, tool crib cabinet, vending drawer system. Virtual Cabinets: Coolant shed, warehouse racking, outdoor storage containers.

    "summary": "Assembly Kits Also known as: Item Assemblies, Kit Items, Assembly Build The Assembly tab allows you to create items that represent a sum of other items. When enabled, an “Assembly Kit” becomes its own item but is tied to the quantities of its component parts. Enabling an Assembly Kit Navigate to the Items module from the Dashboard. Create or edit the item you want to use as a kit. Check Assembly Kit Enabled. The Assembly tab will appear. On the Assembly tab, add the component items and their required quantities. Save changes. How Assemblies Work The Assembly Kit is issued like a normal item. When issued, the system automatically deducts quantities of the component items from inventory. The kit itself does not hold stock — inventory is tracked at the component level. Example: Assembly Kit = Starter Pack 1 × Safety Glasses 2 × Gloves (Pair) 1 × Dust Mask Issuing 1 Starter Pack deducts these items from inventory. Editing or Removing Assemblies To edit quantities, change the number on the Assembly tab. To remove an item from the assembly, delete it from the list. To disable the assembly kit, remove all items from the Assembly tab and uncheck Assembly Kit Enabled. Assembly Kits at the Kiosk Employees see the Assembly Kit as one item. When they check it out, the linked items are deducted automatically. If any component is out of stock, the system will not issue the kit. FAQ What is the difference between an Assembly Kit and a regular item? An Assembly Kit is a “virtual item” that consumes multiple other items when issued. Can an item be both a normal stock item and part of an assembly? Yes. Items can be issued individually and also be part of one or more assembly kits. What happens if one of the components is out of stock? The assembly cannot be issued until all required items are available. Can assemblies be nested? No. You cannot include an assembly kit inside another assembly kit. Related Topics Items Overview Creating a New Item Unit Info Additional Item Tabs Suppliers"

    "summary": "Items The Items module is where you manage every item in FTS. Items can represent anything from cutting tools to maintenance supplies, and they are the backbone of the system. Also known as: Inventory Items, Parts, Tools What Items Are Each item has a unique Item ID that identifies it in the system. Items can be linked to Suppliers, Categories, Locations, and Reporting Fields. Items can be issued, returned, adjusted, or scrapped depending on their type. An item may have additional settings that appear based on its type (e.g., Semi-Consumables). Item Types There are three main item types in FTS: Consumable: Items that are not expected to be returned once issued. Example: inserts, paper, cleaning supplies. Can be Adjusted (returned unused into stock). Semi-Consumable: Items that may be reused but are eventually scrapped. Extra options: Usage Tracking Enabled: Prompts for usage details when the item is returned. Data appears in the Transaction Report. Auto Scrap: After a set number of days (set at the Station level), the item is automatically scrapped if not returned. Return As Other Item: Allows the item to be returned as a different item (commonly used for returning “used” versions). Example: drill bits, end mills, safety gear with limited life. Can be Returned (back into stock). Durable: Items that must be returned to remain in inventory. Extra option: Usage Tracking Enabled: Prompts for usage details when returned. Data appears in the Transaction Report. Example: gages, power tools, staplers. Must be Returned (cannot be adjusted like consumables). Item Flags In addition to the three item types, items can be marked with special flags: Used: Marks the item as used. This is for reference only — FTS does not treat it differently in inventory. Assembly Kit Enabled: Makes the item an Assembly Kit. The item itself becomes a virtual container for its component items. Item Type Comparison Feature / Action Consumable Semi-Consumable Durable Can be Adjusted (put back unused) ✅ ❌ ❌ Can be Returned (after use) ❌ ✅ ✅ Usage Tracking Enabled ❌ ✅ ✅ Auto Scrap ❌ ✅ ❌ Return As Other Item ❌ ✅ ❌ Quick Tip: Use Consumable for items that are gone once issued. Use Semi-Consumable when items may come back, but eventually expire or get scrapped. Use Durable for items that must always be returned and reused. Item Flags In addition to the three item types, items can be marked with special flags: Used: Marks the item as used. This is for reference only — FTS does not treat it differently in inventory. Assembly Kit Enabled: Makes the item an Assembly Kit. The item itself becomes a virtual container for its component items. Key Item Fields Item ID: Unique identifier for the item. Supplier: Supplier used when generating purchase orders. Reference Item ID: Secondary identifier (often an internal part number). Barcode: Barcode data, used for scanning and searching. Commodity Code: Code used to track spend by group (often tied to GL codes). Minimum Order Quantity: Minimum base-unit quantity required for purchase. Default Purchase Unit Size: Order multiples for the item. Note: Commodity Codes are used for spend reporting. If you need to capture job/part/cost center data at checkout, use Reporting Fields instead. Item Tabs When viewing or editing an item, you will see several tabs: Unit Info Locations Categories Open POs History Notes Access Control Assembly (if enabled) Audit Logs See Additional Item Tabs for details. FAQ What’s the difference between Adjust and Return? Adjust: Used for Consumable items. If a consumable is issued but not actually used, it can be adjusted back into stock. Return: Used for Semi-Consumable and Durable items. These items are expected to come back after use, so they are returned into stock rather than adjusted. Why can’t Consumables be Returned? Consumables are treated as “used up” once issued. If you need to put one back, it must be done through an Adjust, not a Return. Why can’t Durables be Adjusted? Durables must always be returned to stay in inventory. Adjust is reserved for unused consumables only. Which item types can use Auto Scrap? Only Semi-Consumables. After a set number of days (configured at the Station level), unreturned Semi-Consumables will be automatically scrapped. Which item types can use Usage Tracking? Both Semi-Consumable and Durable items can have Usage Tracking Enabled, so extra details are logged when they are returned.

    "summary": "Unit Info (Units of Measure) Also known as: Item Units, Unit Info, Units of Measure The Unit Info tab defines how an item is measured, issued, and purchased in FTS. It ensures consistent quantities across purchase orders, stocking, and employee checkouts. Key Unit Fields Base Unit The smallest measurable unit of the item. All other unit conversions are calculated from the base unit. Example: Each drill bit, Box of 10, Case of 100. Reports and purchasing always calculate back to the base unit. Default Issue Unit The unit most commonly issued to employees at the kiosk. Example: If base unit is Each, you may set Pack of 5 as the default issue. At checkout, this unit will be pre-selected. Default Purchase Unit The unit most commonly used when ordering from a supplier. Example: A supplier may only sell in Boxes of 10. When creating purchase orders, this unit will be the default. Allow Issue Determines which units are allowed to be issued at the kiosk. You may allow multiple units (e.g., Each, Pack, Box). Employees can choose any of the allowed units when checking out the item. How Units Work Together Base Unit = the foundation (1 unit). Default Issue = what employees most often take. Default Purchase = how suppliers deliver it. Conversions ensure that every transaction converts back to the base unit for accurate tracking. Example: Base Unit = Each Default Issue = Pack of 5 Default Purchase = Box of 20 If an employee checks out 1 pack, the system deducts 5 Each from stock. If a purchase order is placed for 1 box, the system adds 20 Each into stock. FAQ What’s the difference between Base Unit and Default Issue Unit? Base Unit: The smallest measurement the system uses for calculations. Default Issue Unit: The unit pre-selected for employees when they check out the item. Can I have multiple purchase units? Yes. You can define multiple purchase units, but one must be set as the default. Do all items need a Barcode tied to their units? No. A barcode is optional, but recommended if items are scanned at checkout. What happens if I change the Base Unit later? Changing the Base Unit will affect all transactions, reporting, and conversions. Avoid changing it once items have history.

    "summary": "Purchase Order Approval Process Also known as: PO Approvals, Approval Chain, Approval Workflow The Purchase Order Approval Process ensures that certain POs are reviewed and approved before being sent to suppliers. This is most commonly used for Unapproved POs, but can also apply when company policy requires oversight based on spend or item type. How Approvals Work in POs A purchase order is created. If the supplier has an Approval Process workflow, the PO cannot be marked Approved until the full workflow is complete. This is different from creating a draft PO by unchecking the Approved box. Draft POs are simply incomplete orders and are not tied to the approval workflow. If the workflow applies, the PO is marked Pending Approval. Approvers are notified by email and inside FTS. Each approver reviews the PO: Approve (moves to the next approver or to supplier if final). Reject (sends the PO back to the creator). Add notes or comments to explain decisions. Once the final approver approves, the PO is considered Approved and ready to send to the supplier. Approval Chains You can configure multiple approvers in a chain. Each approver must approve in order before the PO is sent. Approvers can have spending limits, so higher-value POs require additional sign-off. If an approver rejects a PO, it stops the approval process until corrected. Spending Limits Each approver can have a dollar threshold. If the PO amount is below the threshold, that approver can finalize it. If the PO amount is above the threshold, it moves on to the next approver in the chain. Notifications Approvers are automatically notified when a PO needs their approval. Creators are notified once the PO is approved, rejected, or expired. Approval requests can be resent if an approver does not respond. FAQ What happens if a PO is not approved in time? It expires and no order is sent to the supplier. Can I have multiple approvers for the same PO? Yes. Approval chains allow multiple approvers in sequence. Can I set spending limits? Yes. Approvers can have dollar thresholds. If a PO exceeds their limit, it moves to the next approver. Can I resend an approval request? Yes. Approval requests can be resent if an approver does not act. Can approvers add notes? Yes. Approvers can include notes or comments when approving or rejecting a PO. What’s the difference between an unapproved PO and a draft PO? Unapproved PO: A system-created PO type that requires approval before sending. If not approved in time, it expires. Draft PO (unchecking Approved box): A PO that has not yet been finalized by the creator. It is not part of the approval workflow and simply sits in draft until marked Approved.

Why Use Reporting Fields Job/Part Tracking: Track which job, part, or process consumed an item. Cost Allocation: Assign usage to specific projects or departments. Analytics: Build custom fields that match your shop’s processes for deeper reporting insights. Field Settings When creating or editing a reporting field, you can control: Required: Must be filled out before checkout is allowed. Allow User Input: Users can type or scan values at checkout. If unchecked, users must choose from a dropdown. Restrict User Input: Allows users to type into this field, but only accepts values that already exist in the preloaded list. Useful when there are many possible values and you want to prevent mistakes. Works well with barcode scanners — users can scan a valid value instead of typing it. Enable: Activates or deactivates the field at checkout. Name: The name of the field (can be edited later). View Order: Sets the order in which fields appear at the kiosk. Lower numbers show first. Character Min: Minimum number of characters the user must enter if typing. Character Max: Maximum number of characters the user can enter if typing. Ways to Add Data Manually: Add entries one by one to create a dropdown list. Import: Upload a spreadsheet of values to create or update a list (see Importing Data). FAQ Can reporting fields be required? Yes. If a field is marked Required, users must provide a value before checkout. Can I use reporting fields as search categories? No. Use Categories for grouping and searching items. Reporting fields are only used to capture data at checkout. Can employees have default reporting field values? Yes. Employees can be assigned default values for reporting fields so they don’t have to re-enter the same data every time they issue an item. Commonly used for departments, jobs, or cost centers where the values rarely change. Defaults are set in the Employee Tabs.

    "summary": "Importing Data into a Reporting Field Also known as: Upload Reporting Field Data, Import Dropdown Values The Import Tool lets you load many dropdown options into a reporting field at once using an Excel template. Tip: Importing is the fastest way to populate large dropdown lists (e.g., job numbers, part numbers). Steps to Import Navigate to the Reporting Fields module from the Dashboard. Select the reporting field you want to import data into. Click the cloud upload button. Download the Import Template (Excel). Blank template for new data. Sample template for reference (delete sample data before using). Fill out the template with your data list. Save the file and upload it using Choose File → Open. Select whether to Append (add new data to the list) or Replace (clear and replace all data). Click Import to load the data. Error Handling Duplicates: If duplicate values exist, import will fail until fixed. Remove duplicates in the file or cancel them in the upload list. Replace Warning: If you choose Replace, you must confirm before existing data is cleared. Import Failed: If issues remain, you’ll see a failure screen. Repair the file and re-upload. At Checkout If the field has a dropdown list, users will see only those options. If Allow User Input is enabled, users can either pick from the list or type a new value. If disabled, they must select from the list only. FAQ Can I import into multiple reporting fields at once? No. Imports are done one field at a time. What’s the difference between Append and Replace? Append keeps existing values and adds new ones. Replace deletes all current values and loads only the new list. What happens if I forget to delete the sample data? It will be imported into your list unless removed before upload. Related Topics Reporting Fields Overview Creating a New Reporting Field Items"

Available Report Types Purchase Order: Creates and sends an order to the supplier based on inventory levels. Open Purchase Order – Report: Lists all open (not yet received) purchase orders. Reorder Report: Shows items that are low or out of stock and need to be reordered based on the Purchase Method selected below. This has the same items and quantities as a Purchase Order but does not create a PO in the system. Unapproved Purchase Order: Generates a PO that must be approved before being sent to the supplier. This is great for managers who want to review orders before they are placed. Calibration Order: Creates an order for tools/gages that need calibration. Calibration Order Report: A report showing which tools/gages require calibration and their status. This is the same as a Calibration Order but does not create one in the system. 2) Purchase Method Choose the Method used when an automated PO/report is generated.

    "summary": "Supplier Purchase Order Approval Process Also known as: PO Approval Chains, PO Approval Tab, Supplier Approvals The PO Approval Process Tab inside a supplier record allows you to set up a chain of approvers before purchase orders are sent. This creates checks and balances, ensuring large or sensitive orders are reviewed. Why Use PO Approval Process? Adds oversight to supplier orders. Allows setting dollar limits for each approver. Supports a chain of approvals (e.g., Champion → Supervisor → Owner → Accounting). Final approver is responsible for sending the PO to the supplier. Important: The PO Approval Process workflow applies to Approved POs. It prevents a PO from being considered fully approved (ready to send) until all approvers in the chain have signed off. This is different from unchecking the Approved box when creating a PO, which creates a draft PO. Draft POs are not part of the approval workflow. Setting Up the Approval Process Navigate to the Suppliers module from the Dashboard. Select the supplier you want to configure. Open the PO Approval Process Tab. Add approvers and assign approval amounts (see below). Save the supplier record. Selecting Approvers Click Select user here to add an approver. Choose from the list of approved individuals at your site. Only users with backend access will appear in this list. Approval Amounts Each approver must have an approval threshold: $0 → All POs go through this approver. $X (any dollar amount) → Only POs greater than that amount require approval. Example: If set at $200, this approver only reviews POs above $200. POs under $200 are auto-approved. Editing Approvers Approvers can be reordered or updated anytime. To edit, click the approver’s name and enter a new dollar threshold. Save changes to update the approval chain. Notifications Approvers receive an email when a PO requires their review. The email preview shows the PO details and highlights that it is “awaiting approval.” Clicking the PO number in the email opens FTS to review, revise, and approve. Reviewing and Approving POs Black Line Item = Approved & sent to supplier. Red Line Item = Not approved, PO will not be processed until approved. Approvers can: Edit item quantities. Cancel line items. Adjust Min/Max settings if needed. Each approver clicks Save to pass the PO to the next approver. Final Approval The last approver finalizes the PO. They enter the supplier’s email address and send it off. The PO is now active and marked approved. Any changes can be viewed in View Audits. FAQ What happens if no approval process is set for a supplier? POs are sent directly without requiring approval. Can I have multiple approvers? Yes. You can configure a chain of approvers in sequence. What does the $0 threshold mean? It means all POs for that supplier must go through this approver. Who sends the PO to the supplier? The final approver in the chain. Where can I see who still needs to approve? Click PO Process Active on the PO to see the list of approvers and their progress.
